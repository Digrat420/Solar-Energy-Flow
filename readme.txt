Background information:
_______________________
This program exists to simulate the flow of energy (specifically photons) out from the core of the Sun. That being said, it should apply to all stars.

This program was inspired by the work of Project CLEA from Gettysburg College, specifically the latter half of their Flow of Energy Out of the Sun lab.
Their website offers free software useful for various astronomy lab activities, but unfortunately development came to an end and now the software does 
not always work on modern systems. This program was made not as a copy of their work, but for the purpose of attempting to provide the same 
educational experience for learning the concepts. No assets were reused in the development of this program, and I have not received funding for 
this project.

Feel free to use this as you will.

Program description:
_______________________

This program generates random particles beginning at the center of the chosen star, according to the option chosen. Each particle does a random walk
to then move around, and a tracker counts the total number of movements. Whenever a particle leaves the bounds of the circle representing the star,
it is removed. By changing the size of the star (measured in pixels) and knowing the number of particles, one should be able to find a correlation
between the size of the star and the average number of movements required for a particle to escape the star.

This program is still under development, so please pardon any issues.

Currently known issues include inconsistent particle deletion. Some particles will disappear at differing distances from the star, although the effect 
is minor and should not meaningfully affect program usage.


A student guide should be available for use as well, which has questions for students to work through as they use this program. The student guide will 
likely change and improve over time, same as this program.
